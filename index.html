    <h1>VaaradhiAI</h1>

    <p>
      Traditional education in India, especially for competitive exams, emphasizes rote memorization and standardized curricula, failing to address core first principles of learning: knowledge emerges from experience, not passive data accumulation; the brain forgets irrelevant information to conserve energy; and 99 % of studied content—such as disconnected history, geography, or unused languages—is wasted without tying to real problems or personal aptitude. This system prioritizes grades over true understanding, leading to mismatched skills for the 10 lakh people added to the workforce monthly, and ignores the need for effortful, relevant engagement that builds lasting mastery through failure, exploration, and self-explanation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vaaradhi's personalization approach revolutionizes this by adapting in real-time to each learner's strengths, weaknesses, and progress, guided by first principles like teaching problems over tools and fostering aptitude through experiential paths.
